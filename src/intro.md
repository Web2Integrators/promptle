Machine learning tools like [DALLE-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F), are making it super easy to generate images and art based on a simple text prompt. For example, the image below is generated with:

> woman and a futuristic robot, playing a game about mindfulness, meditation, deep thoughts, wide angle, abstract, centered, symmetric

Promptle is a game where players are given the output image generated by one of this systems and they have to guess the prompt used to generate it.
