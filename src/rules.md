## Rules and clues

- Look at the image, what is in there, adjectives and styles.
- The first and last letter are always given as a clue.
- Like [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle), the colors of the tiles reveal how close your guess was to the word.

  - ðŸŸ© Green: the guessed letter is in the right spot
  - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: the guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot
  - ðŸŸ¥ Red: the guessed letter is not in the word

- Players can make a total of 5 mistakes to **guess all the 5 words**.
- The words are always in the **same order** as the original prompt.
- Articles, prepositions, conjunctions and words smaller than 3 letters are always filtered out.
